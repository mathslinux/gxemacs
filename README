** How to add a new emacs config
Put your elisp file to my-lisp directory, remove the file to SXXXfilename.el, 
if you want add two or more files, e.g. a.el and b.el, b.el depends a.el, 
you must rename a.el and b.el like this: SXXXa.el SMMMb.el, which XXX, MMM 
is a int number, and XXX is small than MMM.

** What's the naming rule of file in my-lisp directory
Emacs config file(.emacs) will load all files whose name like SXXXfilename.el. 
The order of loading depends the number in name. e.g S129a.el will be
load earlier than S130b.el. key map config file whose name is S130b.el
will be loaded at the end.
